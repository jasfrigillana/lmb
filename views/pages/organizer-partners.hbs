                        <!-- <h4><strong>LMB History</strong></h4> -->

                        <p>TThe Land Management Bureau (LMB) was established on September 2, 1901 under Act 218 as the Insular Bureau of Public Lands (IBPL) with the mandate of supervising the survey and distribution of public lands in the Philippine Islands. LMB became a staff bureau of the Department of Environment of Natural Resources (DENR) upon its creation under Executive Order No. 192 in June 1987.</p>
                        <p>For more than a century, the Bureau is in the forefront of the effort of the government to promote social equity by distributing public agricultural lands to the rural masses. Since 1901, the LMB is true to its mandate of serving the Filipino people by alleviating poverty and promoting social equality through public land distribution.</p>
